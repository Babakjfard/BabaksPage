  abstract  = "Airborne laser scanning of forests has been shown to provide
               accurate terrain models and, at the same time, estimates of
               multiple resource inventory variables through active sensing of
               three-dimensional (3D) forest vegetation. Brief overviews of
               airborne laser scanning technology [often referred to as ``light
               detection and ranging'' (LIDAR)] and research findings on its
               use in forest measurement and monitoring are presented.
               Currently, many airborne laser scanning missions are flown with
               specifications designed for terrain mapping, often resulting in
               data sets that do not contain key information needed for
               vegetation measurement. Therefore, standards and specifications
               for airborne laser scanning missions are needed to insure their
               usefulness for vegetation measurement and monitoring, rather
               than simply terrain mapping (e.g., delivery of all return data
               with reflection intensity). Five simple, easily understood
               LIDAR-derived forest data products are identified that would
               help insure that forestry needs are considered when
               multiresource LIDAR missions are flown. Once standards are
               developed, there is an opportunity to maximize the value of
               permanent ground plot remeasurements by also collecting airborne
               laser data over a limited number of plots each year.",

               widely documented in scientific literature. Observations of
               urban--rural air temperature differences---or urban heat islands
               (UHIs)---have been reported for cities and regions worldwide,
               often with local field sites that are extremely diverse in their
               physical and climatological characteristics. These sites are
               usually described only as ``urban'' or ``rural,'' leaving much
               uncertainty about the actual exposure and land cover of the
               sites. To address the inadequacies of urban--rural description,
               the ``local climate zone'' (LCZ) classification system has been
               developed. The LCZ system comprises 17 zone types at the local
               scale (102 to 104 m). Each type is unique in its combination of
               surface structure, cover, and human activity. Classification of
               sites into appropriate LCZs requires basic metadata and surface
               characterization. The zone definitions provide a standard
               framework for reporting and comparing field sites and their
               temperature observations. The LCZ system is designed primarily
               for urban heat island researchers, but it has derivative uses
               for city planners, landscape ecologists, and global climate
               change investigators.",

                 speed ranged from 127.2 cm/s for women in their seventies to
                 146.2 cm/s for men in their forties. Mean maximum gait speed
                 ranged from 174.9 cm/s for women in their seventies to 253.3
                 cm/s for men in their twenties. Both gait speed measures were
                 reliable (coefficients > or = 0.903) and correlated
                 significantly with age (r > or = -0.210), height (r > or =
                 0.220) and the strengths of four measured lower extremity
                 muscle actions (r = 0.190-0.500). The muscle action strengths
                 most strongly correlated with gait speed were nondominant hip
                 abduction (comfortable speed) and knee extension (maximum
                 speed). CONCLUSIONS: these normative values should give
                 clinicians a reference against which patient performance can
                 be compared in a variety of settings. Gait speed can be
                 expected to be reduced in individuals of greater age and of
                 lesser height and lower extremity muscle strength.",

               coupled Weather Research and Forecasting model and an urban
               canopy model (WRF-UCM). By parameterizing the effects of these
               natural surfaces alongside roadways and buildings, the modified
               WRF-UCM is used to investigate how urban trees, soil, and grass
               dampen the UHI. The modified model was run with 50\% tree cover
               over urban roads and a 10\% decrease in the width of urban
               streets to make space for soil and grass alongside the roads and
               buildings. Results show that, averaged over all urban areas, the
               added vegetation decreases surface air temperature in urban
               street canyons by 4.1 K and road-surface and building-wall
               temperatures by 15.4 and 8.9 K, respectively, as a result of

               propagate downwind and alter the temperature gradient associated
               with the Chesapeake Bay breeze and, therefore, alter the
               strength of the bay breeze. The impact of building height on the

               residential building heights by 2.5 m results in up to 0.4-K

                 increased deaths and illness is substantial, and concern over
                 this issue is rising because of climate change. Adverse health
                 impacts from heat waves can be avoided, and epidemiologic
                 studies have identified specific population and community
                 characteristics that mark vulnerability to heat waves.
                 OBJECTIVES: We situated vulnerability to heat in geographic
                 space and identified potential areas for intervention and
                 further research. METHODS: We mapped and analyzed 10
                 vulnerability factors for heat-related morbidity/mortality in
                 the United States: six demographic characteristics and two
                 household air conditioning variables from the U.S. Census
                 Bureau, vegetation cover from satellite images, and diabetes
                 prevalence from a national survey. We performed a factor
                 analysis of these 10 variables and assigned values of
                 increasing vulnerability for the four resulting factors to
                 each of 39,794 census tracts. We added the four factor scores
                 to obtain a cumulative heat vulnerability index value.
                 RESULTS: Four factors explained > 75\% of the total variance
                 in the original 10 vulnerability variables: a)
                 social/environmental vulnerability (combined
                 education/poverty/race/green space), b) social isolation, c)
                 air conditioning prevalence, and d) proportion
                 elderly/diabetes. We found substantial spatial variability of
                 heat vulnerability nationally, with generally higher
                 vulnerability in the Northeast and Pacific Coast and the
                 lowest in the Southeast. In urban areas, inner cities showed
                 the highest vulnerability to heat. CONCLUSIONS: These methods
                 provide a template for making local and regional heat
                 vulnerability maps. After validation using health outcome

               trends in proximity to the most populous metropolitan areas of

               eliminated or adjusted for use in continental and global
               analyses of climate change, few studies have addressed how
               temperatures are changing in the areas most vulnerable to the

               temperature data from urban and proximate rural stations for 50
               large US metropolitan areas are analysed to establish the mean
               decadal rate of change in urban temperatures, rural

  abstract = "Remote sensing of urban heat islands (UHIs) has traditionally
              used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the
              indicator of vegetation abundance to estimate the land surface
              temperature (LST)--vegetation relationship. This study
              investigates the applicability of vegetation fraction derived
              from a spectral mixture model as an alternative indicator of
              vegetation abundance. This is based on examination of a Landsat
              Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image of Indianapolis City,
              IN, USA, acquired on June 22, 2002. The transformed ETM+ image
              was unmixed into three fraction images (green vegetation, dry
              soil, and shade) with a constrained least-square solution. These
              fraction images were then used for land cover classification
              based on a hybrid classification procedure that combined maximum
              likelihood and decision tree algorithms. Results demonstrate that
              LST possessed a slightly stronger negative correlation with the
              unmixed vegetation fraction than with NDVI for all land cover
              types across the spatial resolution (30 to 960 m). Correlations
              reached their strongest at the 120-m resolution, which is
              believed to be the operational scale of LST, NDVI, and vegetation
              fraction images. Fractal analysis of image texture shows that the
              complexity of these images increased initially with pixel
              aggregation and peaked around 120 m, but decreased with further
              aggregation. The spatial variability of texture in LST was
              positively correlated with those in NDVI and in vegetation
              fraction. The interplay between thermal and vegetation dynamics
              in the context of different land cover types leads to the
              variations in spectral radiance and texture in LST. These
              variations are also present in the other imagery, and are
              responsible for the spatial patterns of urban heat islands. It is
              suggested that the areal measure of vegetation abundance by
              unmixed vegetation fraction has a more direct correspondence with
              the radiative, thermal, and moisture properties of the Earth's

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: High temperatures have substantial impacts on
                 mortality and, with growing concerns about climate change,
                 numerous studies have developed projections of future
                 heat-related deaths around the world. Projections of
                 temperature-related mortality are often limited by
                 insufficient information necessary to formulate hypotheses
                 about population sensitivity to high temperatures and future
                 demographics. OBJECTIVES: This study has derived projections
                 of temperature-related mortality in New York City by taking
                 into account future patterns of adaptation or demographic
                 change, both of which can have profound influences on future
                 health burdens. METHODS: We adopt a novel approach to modeling
                 heat adaptation by incorporating an analysis of the observed
                 population response to heat in New York City over the course
                 of eight decades. This approach projects heat-related
                 mortality until the end of the 21st century based on observed
                 trends in adaptation over a substantial portion of the 20th
                 century. In addition, we incorporate a range of new scenarios
                 for population change until the end of the 21st century. We
                 then estimate future heat-related deaths in New York City by
                 combining the changing temperature-mortality relationship and
                 population scenarios with downscaled temperature projections
                 from the 33 global climate models (GCMs) and two
                 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). RESULTS: The

               study uses six critical on-site variables such as surface
               albedo, sky view factor, altitude, shrub cover, tree cover and
               average height to floor area ratio to carry out analysis in five
               data sets. The climatic parameters and physical characteristics
               were measured and surveyed, respectively in 216 stations in
               high-rise high-density residential developments of coastal Hong
               Kong. The data set is mainly categorised into peak summer clear
               sky days (PSCS-days), peak summer partially cloudy days
               (PSPC-days) and late summer days to address the issues related
               to cloudy sky conditions in Hong Kong. The trend analysis shows
               that at a lower sky view factor, ranging from 0.1 to 0.25, shrub
               cover as low as 10--15\% in a 1000 m2 open area is more
               effective in reducing outdoor temperature than the same level of
               tree cover in a location with a higher sky view factor (0.4 or
               above). The regression models used in this study were able to
               explain the influence of on-site variables on vegetation in
               lowering the outdoor temperature within the respective urban
               settings. In high-rise high-density environments, on-site
               variables such as sky view factor and altitude have a
               substantial impact on the influence of vegetation in lowering
               outdoor temperature. However, off-site variables such as high
               urban density and anthropogenic heat could negate the behaviour
               of sky view factor and altitude. The study suggests that
               increasing the tree cover from 25\% to 40\% in the pocket parks
               in coastal area residential developments of Hong Kong could
               reduce daytime urban heat island intensity (UHI) by further 0.5

                 Perhaps because of the diversity of communities engaged in
                 heat wave monitoring and research, there is no single,
                 standard definition of a heat wave. Experts differ in which

                 ancillary variables to incorporate into heat wave definitions.
                 While there is value in this diversity of perspectives, the
                 lack of a unified index can cause confusion when discussing

              urbanization and industrialization of human civilization. The
              large amount of heat generated from urban structures, as they
              consume and re-radiate solar radiations, and from the
              anthropogenic heat sources are the main causes of UHI. The two
              heat sources increase the temperatures of an urban area as
              compared to its surroundings, which is known as Urban Heat Island
              Intensity (UHII). The problem is even worse in cities or
              metropolises with large population and extensive economic
              activities. The estimated three billion people living in the
              urban areas in the world are directly exposed to the problem,
              which will be increased significantly in the near future. Due to
              the severity of the problem, vast research effort has been
              dedicated and a wide range of literature is available for the
              subject. The literature available in this area includes the
              latest research approaches, concepts, methodologies, latest
              investigation tools and mitigation measures. This study was
              carried out to review and summarize this research area through an
              investigation of the most important feature of UHI. It was

              the most important role which should be investigated in details
              to study urban heating especially the UHI. It was also concluded

                 historical baseline period. METHODS: After ascertaining the
                 relationship between daily mean ambient air temperature and
                 daily mortality in Skopje, we modelled the evolution of
                 ambient temperatures in the city under a Representative
                 Concentration Pathway scenario (RCP8.5) and the evolution of
                 the city population in two future time periods: 2026-2045 and
                 2081-2100, and in a past time period (1986-2005) to serve as
                 baseline for comparison. We then calculated the projected
                 average annual mortality attributable to heat in the absence
                 of adaptation or acclimatization during those time windows,
                 and evaluated the contribution of each source of uncertainty
                 on the final impact. RESULTS: Our estimates suggest that,
                 compared to the baseline period (1986-2005), heat-related
                 mortality in Skopje would more than double in 2026-2045, and
                 more than quadruple in 2081-2100. When considering the impact
                 in 2081-2100, sampling variability around the heat-mortality
                 relationship and climate model explained 40.3 and 46.6 \% of

                 the hazard is likely to escalate with the increased future
                 temperatures presently predicted by climate change models. The
                 impact of heatwaves is often felt strongest in towns and
                 cities where populations are concentrated and where the
                 climate is often unintentionally modified to produce an urban
                 heat island effect; where urban areas can be significantly
                 warmer than surrounding rural areas. The purpose of this
                 interdisciplinary study is to integrate remotely sensed urban
                 heat island data alongside commercial social segmentation data
                 via a spatial risk assessment methodology in order to
                 highlight potential heat health risk areas and build the
                 foundations for a climate change risk assessment. This paper
                 uses the city of Birmingham, UK as a case study area. RESULTS:
                 When looking at vulnerable sections of the population, the
                 analysis identifies a concentration of ``very high'' risk
                 areas within the city centre, and a number of pockets of
                 ``high risk'' areas scattered throughout the conurbation.
                 Further analysis looks at household level data which yields a
                 complicated picture with a considerable range of
                 vulnerabilities at a neighbourhood scale. CONCLUSIONS: The
                 results illustrate that a concentration of ``very high'' risk
                 people live within the urban heat island, and this should be
                 taken into account by urban planners and city centre

               coverage, particularly in rural areas. Since temperature can

               often inadequate for studies on the health effects of extreme
               temperature and climate change. Satellites can provide us with
               daily physical surface temperature (Ts) measurements, enabling
               us to estimate daily Ta. In this study, we aimed to extend our
               previous work on predicting Ta from Ts in Massachusetts by
               predicting 24 h Ta means on a 1 km grid across the Northeast and
               Mid-Atlantic states, extending both the temporal and spatial
               coverage, improving upon the methodology and validating our
               model in other geographical regions across the Northeastern part
               of the USA. We used mixed model regressions to first calibrate
               Ts and Ta measurements, regressing Ta measurements against
               day-specific random intercepts, and fixed and random Ts slopes.
               Then to capture the ability of neighboring cells to fill in the
               cells with missing Ts values, we regress the Ta predicted from
               the first mixed effects model against the mean of the Ta
               measurements on that day, separately for each grid cell.
               Out-of-sample tenfold cross-validation was used to quantify the
               accuracy of our predictions. Our model performance was excellent
               for both days with available Ts and days without Ts observations
               (mean out-of-sample R2 = 0.95 and R2 = 0.94 respectively). We
               demonstrate how Ts can be used reliably to predict daily Ta at
               high resolution in large geographical areas even in

               period has benefited from conceptual advances made in
               microclimatology and boundary-layer climatology in general. The
               role of scale, heterogeneity, dynamic source areas for turbulent
               fluxes and the complexity introduced by the roughness sublayer
               over the tall, rigid roughness elements of cities is described.
               The diversity of urban heat islands, depending on the medium
               sensed and the sensing technique, is explained. The review
               focuses on two areas within urban climatology. First, it
               assesses advances in the study of selected urban climatic
               processes relating to urban atmospheric turbulence (including

              have developed climate action plans designed to reduce emissions
              of greenhouse gases, rising concentrations of greenhouse gases
              typically are not the strongest driver of warming in cities. Our

  abstract = "Abstract The detection of urban heat island (UHI) is generally
              conducted from ground observations of air temperature and remote
              sensing of land surface temperature (LST). Satellite remotely
              sensed LST has many merits, such as global coverage and
              consistent periodicity, which overcomes the weaknesses of ground
              observations related to the footprint, site distributions, and
              costs. For human related studies and urban climatology, air
              temperatures are equally important. This study explores the
              potential to estimate the near-surface air and dew-point
              temperatures from the MODIS 07 atmospheric profile product
              (MOD07\_L2) to capture the UHI dynamics at 5 km resolution. Four
              mega-cities in North America: Phoenix, Houston, Chicago, and
              Toronto, are evaluated during 2003--2013 summers. The comparison
              between the MODIS near-surface temperature and the ground
              observations suggests an accuracy of 3--7 K RMSE for different
              cities and times of day. For air temperature, the Aqua overpass
              has better agreements, and nighttime has higher accuracy than
              daytime in most cases. In general, very dry (Phoenix) and very
              moist (Houston) climate conditions increase the variability of
              the MODIS temperature accuracy. This study also develops an urban
              heat island curve (UHIC) to represent UHI intensity by
              integrating the urban surface heterogeneity in a curve, showing
              the relationship between air temperature and urban fraction. UHIC
              provides a new way to quantify UHI city by city, which emphasizes
              the temperature gradients, consequently decreasing the impact of
              data biases.",
