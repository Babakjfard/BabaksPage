{{< alert info >}} This blog is created and maintained by Babak J.Fard, a PhD candidate in Sustainability and Data Science ([SDS](https://web.northeastern.edu/sds/)) lab, at Northeastern University. Its purpose is to share ideas, codes, and analyses related to the environmental problems, and to present small samples of using Data Science for Good. Posts may contain only texts, or a mixtures of codes and data analytics. _Leaving comments under the posts are greatly appreciated_.{{< /alert >}}

To this date, [almost all countries have ratified](https://climateanalytics.org/briefings/ratification-tracker/) the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.  There is a [global concern about Climate Change](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/11/05/global-concern-about-climate-change-broad-support-for-limiting-emissions/) and the need for limiting emitions. A [recent study](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/?est=happening&type=value&geo=national) at Yale shows that 70% of Americans think global warming is happening. Since the achievement of [the agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/what-is-the-paris-agreement) on Dec 2015, different activities have been organized throughout the world to get closer to its goals. Some of these efforts include:

* [Global Goals](https://www.globalgoals.org/): Combating Climate Change is one of the 17 global goals defined in this list (Goal 13), although all the goals seem to be intertwined and very important for creating a better world.
    
* [C40 Cities](https://www.c40.org/): At this time it consists of 96 affiliated cities throughout the world, and its goal is _"to drive urban action that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, while increasing the health, wellbeing and economic opportunities of urban citizens"_.
    
* [World Bank Cities](worldbank.org/urban): _"The World Bank invests an average of $6 billion in urban development and resilience projects every year. It aims to build sustainable cities and communities through an urbanization process that is inclusive, resilient and low carbon, productive, and livable.”_
    
* [Science Based Targets](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/): _"It is a collaboration between [CDP](www.cdp.net), the United Nations Global Compact ([UNGC](www.unglobalcompact.org)), World Resources Institute ([WRI](www.wri.org)), and the World Wide Fund for Nature ([WWF](wwf.panda.org))”_ . The group _"champions science-based target setting as a powerful way of boosting companies’ competitive advantage in the transition to the low-carbon economy.”_ At this time it works with 488 companies throughout the world to take science-based climate actions. 
    
* [AGU's Thriving Earth Exchange](https://thrivingearthexchange.org/): Its goal is to _"advances community solutions by helping scientists, community leaders and sponsors work together to solve local challenges related to natural resources, climate change and natural hazards.”_

At the same time the advancements in Data Science have caused many improvements in different matters and decison makings. It is a great opportunity to use data science for better understanding and tackling different problems facing the life of all habitats on earth. _*Data Science for Earth*_. 

As a long time enthusiast and self-learned programmer, while pursuing official studies and jobs in civil and environmental engineering related matters, I found a passion for using data science in improving the quality of life on earth. The goal of initiating, and hopefully continuing, this blog is to get in contact with people coming from different backgrounds but the similar passion of making the world a better place. I hope you can find interesting materials in this blog, *worthy enough to leave comments!*
