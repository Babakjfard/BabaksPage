      <description>Heatwaves are prolonged periods of high temperature that can have detrimental effects on human health, ecosystem, and power consumption. I was surprised when I learned that in the United States, the loss of human life caused by heatwaves exceeds that caused by all other weather events combined, including lightning, floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes[Klinenberg (2015)]. At that time, I was doing literature review for a project looking into the heatwaves for the town of Brookline, MA.</description>
