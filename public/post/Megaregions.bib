abstract = {Statistical methods are developed for comparing regression coefficients between models in the setting where one of the models is nested in the other. Comparisons of this kind are of interest whenever two explanations of a given phenomenon are specified as linear models. In this case, researchers should ask whether the coefficients associated with a given set of predictors change in a significant way when other predictors or covariates are added as controls. Simple calculations based on quantities provided by routines for regression analysis can be used to obtain the standard errors and other statistics that are required. Results are also given for the class of generalized linear models (e.g., logistic regression, log-linear models, etc.). We recommend fundamental change in strategies for model comparison in social research as well as modifications in the presentation of results from regression or regression-type models.},

The Contiguous United States and the nine climatologically homogeneous regions therein. 

STUDY FOCUS
Understanding droughts in a climate context remains a major challenge. Over the United States, the commonly used drought indices suggest a decreasing trend in severity with no significant trend in the spatial coverage of droughts. While previous studies show hydroclimate extremes, including droughts, do not necessarily follow the comparable trends exhibited by their averages, this study for the first time distinctly delineates trends in the spatial coverage of extreme meteorological droughts independently from the mean. Multiple observational data sets, as well as years indicating possibly anomalous droughts, are carefully examined to characterize data-dependent uncertainties and trends. The Standardized Precipitation Index is computed at a time scale of six months to capture the seasonality of drought. The nonlinear dependence among drought attributes necessitates the use of a copula-based tool from probability theory, leading to the development of severity-duration-frequency curves. 

NEW HYDROLOGICAL INSIGHTS FOR THE REGION
The paper finds spatial coverage of extreme meteorological drought in the recent years (post-2010) exceeds that of the iconic droughts of the 1930s (the Dust Bowl era), and the 1950s. These results are in contrast with trends in spatial variance that does not exhibit any statistically significant trend. In addition, we find drought persistence remains relatively stationary over the last half century. The findings can inform drought monitoring and planning, and improve future drought resilience.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. SUMMARY The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. There-fore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {Benjamini and Hochberg suggest that the false discovery rate may be the appropriate error rate to control in many applied multiple testing problems. A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional family wise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

GW models suit situations when data are not described well by some global model, but where there are spatial regions where a suitably localised calibration provides a better description. The approach uses a moving window weighting technique, where localised models are found at target locations. Outputs are mapped to provide a useful exploratory tool into the nature of the data spatial heterogeneity. GWmodel includes: GW summary statistics, GW principal components analysis, GW regression, GW regression with a local ridge compensation, and GW regression for prediction; some of which are provided in basic and robust forms.},

abstract = {This paper presents three multivariate geostatistical algorithms for incorporating a digital elevation model into the spatial prediction of rainfall: simple kriging with varying local means; kriging with an external drift; and colocated cokriging. The techniques are illustrated using annual and monthly rainfall observations measured at 36 climatic stations in a 5000km2 region of Portugal. Cross validation is used to compare the prediction performances of the three geostatistical interpolation algorithms with the straightforward linear regression of rainfall against elevation and three univariate techniques: the Thiessen polygon; inverse square distance; and ordinary kriging. Larger prediction errors are obtained for the two algorithms (inverse square distance, Thiessen polygon) that ignore both the elevation and rainfall records at surrounding stations. The three multivariate geostatistical algorithms outperform other interpolators, in particular the linear regression, which stresses the importance of accounting for spatially dependent rainfall observations in addition to the colocated elevation. Last, ordinary kriging yields more accurate predictions than linear regression when the correlation between rainfall and elevation is moderate (less than 0.75 in the case study).},

The methods, tested against ordinary kriging and universal kriging of the target variables, include multi-linear regression, isotopic cokriging, heterotopic cokriging and regression-kriging models A, B and C. Prediction performance by ordinary kriging and universal kriging was comparatively poor as the methods do not use covariation of the predictor variable with terrain attributes. Heterotopic cokriging outperformed isotopic cokriging because the former utilised more of the local information from the covariables. The combined regression-kriging methods generally performed well. Both the regression-kriging model C and heterotopic cokriging performed well when soil variables were predicted into a relatively finer gridded digital elevation model (DEM) and when all the local information was utilised. Regression-kriging model C generally performed best and is, perhaps, more flexible than heterotopic cokriging. Potential for further research and developments rests in improving the regression part of model C.},

This corresponds to an additional electricity penalty of about 21 (±10.4) W per degree of temperature increase and per person. In parallel, analysis of fifteen studies examining the impact of ambient temperature on the total electricity consumption, showed that the actual increase of the electricity demand per degree of temperature increase varies between 0.5{\%} and 8.5{\%}.},

abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) is considered as one of the major problems in the 21st century posed to human beings as a result of urbanization and industrialization of human civilization. The large amount of heat generated from urban structures, as they consume and re-radiate solar radiations, and from the anthropogenic heat sources are the main causes of UHI. The two heat sources increase the temperatures of an urban area as compared to its surroundings, which is known as Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII). The problem is even worse in cities or metropolises with large population and extensive economic activities. The estimated three billion people living in the urban areas in the world are directly exposed to the problem, which will be increased significantly in the near future. Due to the severity of the problem, vast research effort has been dedicated and a wide range of literature is available for the subject. The literature available in this area includes the latest research approaches, concepts, methodologies, latest investigation tools and mitigation measures. This study was carried out to review and summarize this research area through an investigation of the most important feature of UHI. It was concluded that the heat re-radiated by the urban structures plays the most important role which should be investigated in details to study urban heating especially the UHI. It was also concluded that the future research should be focused on design and planning parameters for reducing the effects of urban heat island and ultimately living in a better environment. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

abstract = {The climate change and the proceeding urbanization create future health challenges. Consequently, more people around the globe will be impaired by extreme weather events, such as heat waves. This study investigates the causes for the emergence of surface urban heat islands and its change during heat waves in 70 European cities. A newly created climate class indicator, a set of meaningful landscape metrics, and two population-related parameters were applied to describe the Surface Urban Heat Island Magnitude (SUHIM) – the mean temperature increase within the urban heat island compared to its surrounding, as well as the Heat Magnitude (HM) – the extra heat load added to the average summer SUHIM during heat waves. We evaluated the relevance of varying urban parameters within linear models. The exemplary European-wide heat wave in July 2006 was chosen and compared to the average summer conditions using MODIS land surface temperature with an improved spatial resolution of 250 m. The results revealed that the initial size of the urban heat island had significant influence on SUHIM. For the explanation of HM the size of the heat island, the regional climate and the share of central urban green spaces showed to be critical. Interestingly, cities of cooler climates and cities with higher shares of urban green spaces were more affected by additional heat during heat waves. Accordingly, cooler northern European cities seem to be more vulnerable to heat waves, whereas southern European cities appear to be better adapted. Within the ascertained population and climate clusters more detailed explanations were found. Our findings improve the understanding of the urban heat island effect across European cities and its behavior under heat waves. Also, they provide some indications for urban planners on case-specific adaptation strategies to adverse urban heat caused by heat waves.},

abstract = {Background: The on-going climate change is predicted to yield a growing number of extreme climate events which will increase in both intensity and frequency. Increased longevity is changing society's demographics. It is very likely this will have a direct impact on population health. Many studies have previously shown that the elderly in a society are among the most vulnerable to heat waves. Objectives: With a rapidly growing number of publications on this subject the objective was to review the recent literature for research regarding the impact of heat waves and elevated temperature on the elderly with regards to mortality and morbidity. Methods: PubMed was searched to identify studies published in English between 1st of January 2008 and 31st of December 2010 using the following key words: heat wave, mortality, morbidity, elderly and temperature. The relationship between high temperature and mortality and/or morbidity had to be studied. Results for the elderly had to be provided. Results: Six studies of temperature-morbidity-relationship were found and 24 studies of temperature-mortality-relationship. Studies consistently reported increases in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, as appeared also respiratory admissions to do during hot days and heat waves. However, the number of studies on morbidity published was much fewer. Few studies reported social, medical and environmental susceptibility factors. Conclusions: Future research should focus on studying susceptibilities and to non-fatal events which are not as studied as mortality. Studies on the modification of type of urban environment, housing and mortality and morbidity in the elderly population are also needed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Spatial nonstationarity is a condition in which a simple “global” model cannot explain the relationships between some sets of variables. The nature of the model must alter over space to reflect the structure within the data. In this paper, a technique is developed, termed geographically weighted regression, which attempts to capture this variation by calibrating a multiple regression model which allows different relationships to exist at different points in space. This technique is loosely based on kernel regression. The method itself is introduced and related issues such as the choice of a spatial weighting function are discussed. Following this, a series of related statistical tests are considered which can be described generally as tests for spatial nonstationarity. Using Monte Carlo methods, techniques are proposed for investigating the null hypothesis that the data may be described by a global model rather than a non-stationary one and also for testing whether individual regression coefficients are stable over geographic space. These techniques are demonstrated on a data set from the 1991 U.K. census relating car ownership rates to social class and male unemployment. The paper concludes by discussing ways in which the technique can be extended.},

abstract = {In this study, we present a collection of local models, termed geographically weighted (GW) models, that can be found within the GWmodel R package. A GW model suits situations when spatial data are poorly described by the global form, and for some regions the localised fit provides a better description. The approach uses a moving window weighting technique, where a collection of local models are estimated at target locations. Commonly, model parameters or outputs are mapped so that the nature of spatial heterogeneity can be explored and assessed. In particular, we present case studies using: (i) GW summary statistics and a GW principal components analysis; (ii) advanced GW regression fits and diagnostics; (iii) associated Monte Carlo significance tests for non-stationarity; (iv) a GW discriminant analysis; and (v) enhanced kernel bandwidth selection procedures. General Election data sets from the Republic of Ireland and US are used for demonstration. This study is designed to complement a companion GWmodel study, which focuses on basic and robust GW models.},

abstract = {Climate strongly affects energy supply and demand in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and Washington State (WA). We evaluate potential effects of climate change on the seasonality and annual amount of PNW hydropower production, and on heating and cooling energy demand. Changes in hydropower production are estimated by linking simulated streamflow scenarios produced by a hydrology model to a simulation model of the Columbia River hydro system. Changes in energy demand are assessed using gridded estimates of heating degree days (HDD) and cooling degree days (CDD) which are then combined with population projections to create energy demand indices that respond both to climate, future population, and changes in residential air conditioning market penetration. We find that substantial changes in the amount and seasonality of energy supply and demand in the PNW are likely to occur over the next century in response to warming, precipitation changes, and population growth. By the 2040s hydropower production is projected to increase by 4.7–5.0{\%} in winter, decrease by about 12.1–15.4{\%} in summer, with annual reductions of 2.0–3.4{\%}. Larger decreases of 17.1–20.8{\%} in summer hydropower production are projected for the 2080s. Although the combined effects of population growth and warming are projected to increase heating energy demand overall (22–23{\%} for the 2020s, 35–42{\%} for the 2040s, and 56–74{\%} for the 2080s), warming results in reduced per capita heating demand. Residential cooling energy demand (currently less than one percent of residential demand) increases rapidly (both overall and per capita) to 4.8–9.1{\%} of the total demand by the 2080s due to increasing population, cooling degree days, and air conditioning penetration.},
