 To this date, almost all countries have ratified to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. There is a global concern about Climate Change and the need for limiting emotions. A recent study at Yale shows that 70% of Americans think global warming is happening.

At that time, I was doing literature review for a project looking into the heatwaves for the town of Brookline, MA.</description>
