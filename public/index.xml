      <description>I am Babak J.Fard. A PhD candidate at Sustainability and Data Science (SDS) lab, at Northeastern University.
 To this date, almost all countries have ratified to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. There is a global concern about Climate Change and the need for limiting emotions. A recent study at Yale shows that 70% of Americans think global warming is happening. Since the achievement of the agreement on Dec 2015, different activities have been organized in different capacities throughout the world to get closer to the goals of it.</description>

At that time, I was doing literature review for a project looking into the heatwaves for the town of Brookline, MA.</description>
